              "Aquatic ecosystems are regarded as a hub of antibiotic and metal resistance genes. River Ganges is a unique riverine system in India with socio-cultural and economic significance. However, it remains underexplored for its microbiome and associated resistomes along its anthropogenically impacted course. The present study utilized a nanopore sequencing approach to depict the microbial community structure in the sediments of the river Ganges harboring antibiotic and metal resistance genes (A/MRGs) in lower stretches known for anthropogenic impact. Comprehensive microbiome analyses revealed resistance genes against 23 different types of metals and 28 classes of antibiotics. The most dominant ARG category was multidrug resistance, while the most prevalent MRGs conferred resistance against copper and zinc. Seasonal differences dismally affected the microbiota of the Ganges. However, resistance genes for fosmidomycin and tetracycline varied with season ANOVA, p < 0.05. Interestingly, 333 and 334 ARG subtypes were observed at all the locations in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. The taxa associated with the dominant ARGs and MRGs were Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, which are important nosocomial pathogens. A substantial phage diversity for pathogenic and putrefying bacteria at all locations attracts attention for its use to tackle the dissemination of antibiotic and metal-resistant bacteria. This study suggests the accumulation of antibiotics and metals as the driving force for the emergence of resistance genes and the affiliated bacteria trafficking them. The present metagenomic assessment highlights the need for comprehensive, long-term biological and physicochemical monitoring and mitigation strategies toward the contaminants associated with ARGs and MRGs in this nationally important river.
